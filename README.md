# Snake Game

This Python script is an implementation of the classic Snake game using the Pygame library. Players control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

## Prerequisites

Before running the Snake game script, ensure you have the following:

1. **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

2. **Pygame**: Install the Pygame library using `pip`:
   ```
   pip install pygame
   ```

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository or download the script.

2. Open the script in a Python environment or code editor.

3. Run the script:
   ```

   - Right arrow: Move the snake right
   - Up arrow: Move the snake up
   - Down arrow: Move the snake down

5. Eat the food (orange square) to make the snake longer.

6. The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.

7. To restart the game after it's over, press the **Spacebar**.
